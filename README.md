Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing sentiment analysis on text data. Sentiment analysis is a process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative, or neutral. This project utilizes various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and libraries in Python to analyze sentiment.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Techniques to clean and prepare text data for analysis.
Text Vectorization: Methods to convert text data into numerical format.
Model Training: Implementation of machine learning models for sentiment classification.
Evaluation: Assessing the performance of models using various metrics.
Visualization: Plotting results to gain insights from the data.

Structure
The repository contains the following files:

Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook with all the code for sentiment analysis.
data/: Directory containing sample datasets for analysis.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Data
The data directory contains sample datasets used for sentiment analysis. You can replace these with your own datasets if needed. The notebook includes code to load and preprocess this data.

Usage
Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook to:

Load and preprocess the text data.
Vectorize the text using techniques like TF-IDF.
Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).
Evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize the results using plots.
Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or suggestions, feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request.
